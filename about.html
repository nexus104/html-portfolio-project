<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am Art M. Quidilla. I am currently studying in University of the East. When I was a child i was a very
  funny kid who loves talking a lot, but all of that change as I grow up, I prefer being alone now, I dont even know 
  the reason why I am still trying and alive, maybe its because of this girl that gave me the motivation to stay alive,
  fight, learn, and love. Without her I might not be here anymore
</p>

  I am an amatuer coder who dreams to become an I.T student, I will do anything to become knowned and loved. I usually
  love being alone most of the time, but trust me I also need company. I love my girl so much and my family that I will
  do anything for them. I want to be an astronaut before but as time goes by I realize that life isn't like fairy tail 
  after all. Life is like a roller coaster, sometimes it can be fun, sometimes it can be scary, but one thing that makes 
  life truly a roller coaster is, the entertainment we get by continuing the ride.

  Most of the time life sucks but here is a good tip, never let your problems eat you alive, Always ask for help rather
  than letting that pain feed on you and kill you, excercise if ever you have the time to do so, we can't just give up
  on the dreams that we dreamt of before. Continue the path until u succeed. This is Art signing off.
